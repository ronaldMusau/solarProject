#solar panel rotation

This code is supposed to be writen in the aduino.

The code actually helps the solar panels to rotate in the direction of the sun to maximumize energy output.

This is implemeted through the help of the LDR .

It is still not yet a fine version ...yet to release a more defined version soon.
